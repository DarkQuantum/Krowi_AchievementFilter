### Added
- Compatibility with Zygor Guides Viewer for the Blizzard Achievements tab
- Focused, Current Zone, Selected Zone and Excluded category to every tab (option to hide them in unwanted tabs to be added)
- Refresh to World and Widget Event Reminder options
- Options to keep the Achievement Window, Achievement Calendar and/or Data Manager at the last position between sessions

### Fixed
- When an achievement is selected and a criteria is completed, the criteria should show as completed without having to toggle the achievement
- World events should always show time data again (untill Blizzard breaks the API again)
- Opening the Achievement Window during combar is now always possible, even with rebound micro button
- Some bugs new users can experience because some tables do not yet exist

### WotLK Classic
- Enabled the data manager frame
